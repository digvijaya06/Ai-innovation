# 🎟️ Ticket Booking & Checkout Flow

### *The “Booking & State” Master*

A **React-based Ticket Booking application** that implements a **multi-step booking flow** using **React Router** and **Context API / Redux** for state management.
The project demonstrates handling complex forms, preserving application state, implementing price logic, validation rules, and custom CSS styling.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project simulates a real-world **ticket booking and checkout system** where users can:

* Select a travel route
* Choose passenger type (Student / Senior / Regular)
* Specify ticket quantity
* View a detailed price breakdown
* Confirm their booking

The booking state is preserved across routes and page refreshes using centralized state management.

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Multi-Step Booking Form (React Router)

* **Step 1:** Route Selection
* **Step 2:** Passenger Type & Ticket Quantity
* **Step 3:** Booking Confirmation

Navigation between steps is handled using **React Router**, ensuring a smooth step-based flow.

---

### ✅ State Management (Context API / Redux)

* Booking data is stored globally
* User selections persist when:

  * Navigating back and forth between steps
  * Refreshing the browser
* Eliminates prop drilling and improves scalability

---

### ✅ Price Engine

* A centralized utility function calculates ticket price
* Pricing logic:

  ```
  Final Price = Base Route Price – Applicable Discounts
  ```
* Discounts applied based on passenger type:

  * 🎓 Student Discount
  * 👴 Senior Citizen Discount

---

### ✅ Validation Rules

* Users **cannot book more than 5 tickets**
* Form-level validation prevents invalid submissions
* Ensures required fields are completed before proceeding

---

### ✅ UI & Styling

* Custom **CSS** added for:

  * Step navigation
  * Forms & inputs
  * Buttons and layout
  * Price summary cards
* Responsive and clean user interface
